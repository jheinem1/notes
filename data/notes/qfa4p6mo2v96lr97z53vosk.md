> Design an efficient algorithm to update the priority of an entry inside a priority queue. Analyze the problem, design an algorithm for updating the priority queue, and justify the algorithm's optimality.

## Thoughts...

- How might ADJ be different for an algorithm than other examples?
- Is this problem possible?
- Can this problem be solved by something we know about already?
- Are any aspects of this problem undefined?
- What should be our first steps?
