Sitting down and explicitly dealing with all the muddling of the problem and its description. A translation of the original [[ill-defined problem|ser222.analysis-design-justification.ill-defined]] into concrete requirements that can be evaluated.

- This is the most complicated part of AJD
- In analysis, you should define your immediate problem and any useful corollaries
- The answer should be in terms of the problem itself, and not biased towards a possible solution
- It is possible that portions of your analysis will not be needed later
## Steps
1. Identify and address ambiguities in problem statement
2. Generate definitions for ill-specified parts of the problem, along with useful corollaries
3. Using the definitions to propose a more well-specified view of the problem
4. Define metrics
