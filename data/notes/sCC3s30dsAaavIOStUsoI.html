<p>Engineers are often asked to solve design problems most often. Design problems have the flavor of picking one solution among many options, and where the "best" solution may not be immediately apparent and will likely have trade-offs. Some attributes of the solution are not pre-determined such as which programming language, framework, paradigm, etc. to use.</p>
