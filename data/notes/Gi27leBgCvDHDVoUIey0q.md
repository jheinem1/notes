The difference quotient is generally expressed using the formula $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$, however can be expressed serveral ways depening on how the coordinates $P$ and $Q$ are labeled.

Given the coordinates $P(a,f(a))$ and $Q(x,f(x))$, the difference quotient is
$$
m_{sec}=\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}
$$
