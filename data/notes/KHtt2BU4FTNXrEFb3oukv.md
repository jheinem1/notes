## Arithmetic properties
### Associative property
$$
a(bc)=(ab)c
$$
### Commutative property
$$
a+b=b+a
$$
$$
ab=ba
$$
### Distributive/Factoring property
$$
a(b+c)=ab+ac
$$
## Fraction properties
- Fractions added or subtracted need to share the same deoniminator
- Multiplication between fractions is straight across
- Division can be done by multiplying the first fraction by the reciprocal of the second (flip it)
- Can be broken up by numerator, but **not** denominator
## Fraction formulas
### "Bow-tie" method
$$
\frac{a}{b}\plusmn\frac{c}{d}=\frac{ad\plusmn bc}{bd}
$$
### Fraction in numerator of fraction
$$
\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{c}=\frac{a}{bc}
$$
### Fraction in denominator of fraction
$$
\frac{\frac{a}{b}}{c}=\frac{ac}{b}
$$
## Exponent properties
- Multiplying two exponents with the same base add the exponents
    - $a^b+a^c=a^{b+c}$
- An exponent to one degree raised to another multiplies the exponents
    - $(a^n)^x=a^{n*x}$
- Group of numbers raised to the same power can be separated
    - $(ab)^x=a^xb^x$
- Negative exponent can/should be moved to the denominator (or numerator)
    - $a^{-m}=\frac{1}{a^m}$
    - $\frac{1}{a^{-m}}=a^m$
- Dividing exponents means subtraction
    - $\frac{a^n}{a^m}=a^{n-m}$
- Fractions raised to a power can be split up
    - $(\frac{a}{b})^n=\frac{a^n}{b^n}$
- Fractions raised to a negative power can be flipped
    - $\frac{1}{2}^{-1}=\frac{2}{1}$
- Anything to the first degree equals itself
    - $x^1=x$
- Anything to the 0 degree equals 1
    - $x^0=1$
## Radical properties
- The $n$th root of any number is equal to the number to the power of 1 over the root
- The $n$th root of $a$ times $b$ can be split into the $n$th root of $a$ times the $n$th root of $b$
- The nth root of $a$ over $b$ is equal to the $n$th root of $a$ over the $n$th root of $b$
- The $n$th root of $a$ to the power of $m$ is equal to $a$ to the power of $m$ over $n$
- The $n$th root of $a$ to the $n$ power equal $a$ if $n$ is odd
- The $n$th root of $a$ to the $n$ power is the absolute value of $a$ or plus or minus $a$
## Important functions
- Polynomial & linear/constant functions
    - Construction of power functions
- Power functions
    - Like polynomial, but 1 term
    - $x^a$
- Rational functions
    - All polynomials are rational functions
    - $\frac{poly}{poly}$
- Trig functions
    - $\sin$/$\cos$/$\tan$/etc.
- Exponential/log functions
- Piecewise (not as important)
