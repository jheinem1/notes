To evaulate a polynomial (such as $f(x)=x^8-4x^5+\frac12$), all we need is arithmetic. However, algebraic function such as $f(x)=\sqrt[3]{x^4-1}$ and the trigonometric, logarithmic, and exponential functions cannot be evaluated with arithmetic. Because of this, it makes sense to approximate these functions.

[[mat266.taylor-polynomials]] are a good way to do this.
