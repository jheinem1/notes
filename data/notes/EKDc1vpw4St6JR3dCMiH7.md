Because the acceleration of an object moving along a line is given by $a(t)=v\prime(t)$, the relationship between velocity and acceleration is the same as the relationship between position and velocity. Given the acceleration of an object, the change in velocity over an interval $[a,b]$ is
$$
\text{change in velocity}=v(b)-v(a)=\int_a^b{v\prime(t)}{dt}=\int_a^b{a(t)}{dt}\text{.}
$$
## Velocity from Acceleration
Given the acceleration $a(t)$ of an object moving along a line and its initial velocity $v(0)$, the velocity of the object for future times $t\geq0$ is
$$
v(t)=v(0)+\int_0^t{a(x)}{dx}\text{.}
$$
This is a consequence of the [[mat266.fundamental-theorem]].
