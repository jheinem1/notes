We know what to start with, have options for what can be done, and will know the situation when we see it. The solution is *verifiable*, and with more information, a *certificate*.

## Ambiguity
- Most problems have areas that are ambiguous- both in the description and relation to the problem itself
- This could mean
  - Something is unknown
  - Something is under-specified
  - Something cannot be known
- This causes a lot of trouble as it's difficult to determine whether a solution is valid
## Faulty
- The prompt is misleading, contradictory, or incorrect in some way
