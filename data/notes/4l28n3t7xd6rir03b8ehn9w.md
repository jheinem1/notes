## Goals of WMITS

- Minimize time span of inspections
- Minimize amount of paperwork
- Provide a database of all inspections
- Provide an automated channel for information to be requested

## Context

Eventually, a system will be used by multiple users. This means that the system needs to be able to handle many concurrent connections.

## Bug resource reports

Bug resource reports are used to identify bugs during testing and to identify why a bug occurred.
