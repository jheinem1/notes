<p>A garbage collection method that involves storing the number of references to each object.</p>
<p>Every time a reference to an object is dumped from the stack, the reference count is decremented. When the reference count reaches zero, the object can be safely garbage collected.</p>
<p>Likewise, when a reference to an object is loaded into the stack, the reference count is incremented.</p>
<p>This is a much more performant alternative to <a href="/notes/notes/3110043843">Directed Search</a>, but does not handle objects linked to each other outside the stack, which has to be handled separately in languages where this situation can occur.</p>
