The set of all inputs that are defined- usually the x-axis of a graph.

The domain of a function is all real numbers $(-\infty, \infty)$

## Domain issues
- Division by 0
- Negatives in the even root function
    - $\sqrt{-x}$
    - Operations that would result in imaginary numbers
- Negatives (or 0) in a $\log$ function
- Any multiple of $\frac{\pi}{2}+n$ for $\tan{x}$
