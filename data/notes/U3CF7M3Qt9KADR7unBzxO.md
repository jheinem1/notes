- Asking questions is a bit thing in industry
    - Defining a problem is back-and-forth
        - Not even the customer knows what they want
        - It's up to your team to determine what the problem is
    - Problems are too complex for someone to know everything about it
    - Solutions are too varied for anybody to be able to create them at all
    - That said, someone somewhere has the knowledge or expertise you need
- When formulating a question to someone, help them help you
    - Ask the appropriate person
    - Make it specific
    - Make it simple
    - Make it actionable to you
