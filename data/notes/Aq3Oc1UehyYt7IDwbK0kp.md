- Developers build a prototype during the requirements
- Prototype is evaluated by end users
- Users give corrective feedback
- Developers further refine prototype
- When the user is satisfied, the prototype code is brought up to the standards needed for a final product
## Steps
- Preliminary plan developed
- Partial high-level paper model created
- Model becomes source for partial requirements
- Prototype is build with basic attributes
- The designer builds
    - The database
    - User interface
    - Algorithmic functions
- The designer demonstrates the prototype, the user evaluates and suggest improvements
- This loop continues until the user is satisfied
## Strengths
- Customers "see" system requirements as they are gathered
- Developers learn from customers
- More accurate product
- Unexpected requirements can be accommodated
- Steady, visible signs of progress
- Interaction with the prototype stimulates awareness of additional needed functionality
## Weaknesses
- Tendency to abandon structured development for quick fixes
- Bad reputation for "quick-and-dirty" methods
- Maintainability may be poor
- The customer may want the prototype delivered
- Process may continue forever
## When to use
- Requirements unstable
- As the requirements stage of a waterfall model
- Developing user interfaces
- Short-lived demonstrations
- New, original development
- With the analysis and design portions of object-oriented development
