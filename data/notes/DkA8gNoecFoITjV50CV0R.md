Algebraic functions are constructed using the operations of algebra: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and roots. Examples of algebraic functions are $f(x)=\sqrt{2x^3+4}$ and $f(x)=x^{\frac{1}{4}}(x^3+2)$. In general, if an even root (square root, fourth root, and so forth) appears, then the domain does not contain points at which the quantity under the root is negative (and perhaps other points).
