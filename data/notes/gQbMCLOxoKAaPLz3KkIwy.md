(filled-in area represents a slice of a 3D object equivalent to the slice rotated around the provided axis)
## Definition about the $x$-axis
Let $f$ be continuous with $f(x)\geq0$ on the interval $[a,b]$. If the region $R$ bounded by the graph of $f$, the $x$-axis, and the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$ is revolved about the $x$-axis, the volume of the resulting solid of revolution is
$$
V=\int_a^b{\pi f(x)^2}{dx}\text.

## Definition about the $y$-axis
Let $p$ be continuous with $p(y)\geq0$ on the interval $[c,d]$. If the region $R$ bounded by the graph of $p$, the $y$-axis, and the lines $y=c$ and $y=d$ is revolved about the $y$-axis, the volume of the resulting solid of revolution is
$$
V=\int_c^d{\pi p(y)^2}{dy}\text.
