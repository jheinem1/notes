A solution to the problem being solved

- This should build on the results of the analysis approach to construct a solution which meets a metric
  - Design is subjective
- The design can look many ways
  - For simple problems, it could just be "array" or "list"
  - For complex problems, it can take the form of designing an explanation (later backed with an argument)
  - In others, it will literally mean designing an algorithm
