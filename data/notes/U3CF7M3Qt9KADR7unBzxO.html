<ul>
<li>Asking questions is a bit thing in industry
<ul>
<li>Defining a problem is back-and-forth
<ul>
<li>Not even the customer knows what they want</li>
<li>It's up to your team to determine what the problem is</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Problems are too complex for someone to know everything about it</li>
<li>Solutions are too varied for anybody to be able to create them at all</li>
<li>That said, someone somewhere has the knowledge or expertise you need</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>When formulating a question to someone, help them help you
<ul>
<li>Ask the appropriate person</li>
<li>Make it specific</li>
<li>Make it simple</li>
<li>Make it actionable to you</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
