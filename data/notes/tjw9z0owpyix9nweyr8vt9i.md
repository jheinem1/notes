## Limit of a sequence

If the terms of a sequence ${x_n}$ approach a unique number $L$ as $n$ increases (if $a_n$ can be made arbitrarily close to $L$), then the limit $\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n$ **converges** to $L$. If the terms *do not* approach a single number as $n$ increases, the sequence has no limit, and it **diverges**.
