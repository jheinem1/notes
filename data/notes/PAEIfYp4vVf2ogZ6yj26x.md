Slopes of lines and curves play a fundamental role in calculus.

## Definition
A secant line is a line through any two points on a curve. Secant lines are generally denoted as $m_{sec}$.
$$
m_{sec}=\frac{change\ in\ y}{change\ in\ x}=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{(x+h)-x}=\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}
$$

The slope formula $\frac{f(x+h)-f(x)}{h}$ is also known as the [[difference quotient|mat266.functions.difference-quotient]].

The slope of the secant line is the average rate of change of $f$ over the interval $[a,x]$.
