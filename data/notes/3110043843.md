Given a digraph and source `s`, is there a directed path from `s` to `v`?

Given a digraph and a set of source vertices, is there a directed path from any vertex in the set to `v`?

## Search

```java
public class DirectedDFS {
    private boolean[] marked;

    /**
     * Computes the vertices in a digraph reachable from the source vertex `s`.
     * @param G the digraph
     * @param s the source vertex
     */
    public DirectedDFS(Digraph G, int s) {
        marked = new boolean[G.V()];
        dfs(G, s);
    }

    /**
     * Computes the vertices in a digraph reachable from the source vertex `s`.
     * @param G the digraph
     * @param sources the source vertices
     */
    public DirectedDFS(Digraph G, Iterable<Integer> sources) {
        marked = new boolean[G.V()];
        for (int s : sources)
            if (!marked[s]) dfs(G, s);
    }

    private void dfs(Digraph G, int v) {
        marked[v] = true;
        for (int w : G.adj(v))
            if (!marked[w]) dfs(G, w);
    }

    /**
     * Is there a directed path from the source vertex {@code s} to vertex {@code v}?
     * @param v the vertex
     * @return {@code true} if there is a directed path, {@code false} otherwise
     */
    public boolean marked(int v) {
        return marked[v];
    }
}
```

- Directed search is often used in garbage collection
    - However this does require searching through *every* reference, so it is quite slow and not widely used in modern languages
    - Many modern languages with garbage collection use [[ser222.reference-counting]], which doesn't handle edge-cases as well, but is significantly faster
- The idea is that all objects that are on the stack are listed out, then all objects that are reachable from the stack are listed out
    - Remaining objects can be safely garbage collected
