Static analysis is the process of identifying and fixing errors in source code before it is compiled.

## Compiler warnings & errors

- The linter and compiler both check for potential errors in the code and report them to the user as warnings or errors
- Some examples include...
    - Unused variables
    - Uninitialized variables
    - Unreachable code

## Checkstyle (Java)

- Similar to [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) for JavaScript/TypeScript
- Checks for code guideline violations (e.g. indentation, naming, etc.)
    - If possible, provides suggestions for fixing the violations

## FindBugs

- Checks for common bugs in Java code (it's dated and not widely used)

## Metrics

- Checks for structural anomalies (also dated)
