Pressure is a force per unit area.
$$
F=\text{mass}*\text{acceleration}=\text{volume}*\text{density}*g=Ah\rho g
$$
, where $\rho$ is the density of the water, and $g$ is acceleration due to gravity.

## Force-on-dam problem
1. Draw a y-axis on the face of the dam in the vertical direction and choose a convenient origin (usually the base)
2. Find the width function $w(y)$ for each value of $y$ on the face of the dam
3. If the base of the dam is at $y=0$ and the top of the dam is at $y=a$, then the total force on the dam is
$$
F=\int_0^a{\rho g(a-y)w(y)}{dy}\text.
$$
