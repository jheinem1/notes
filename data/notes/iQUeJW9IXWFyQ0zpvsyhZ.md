## Definition about the $x$-axis
Let $f$ and $g$ be continuous functions with $f(x)\geq g(x)\geq0$ on $[a,b]$. Let $R$ be the region bounded by the curves $y=f(x)$ and $y=g(x)$, and the lines $x=a$ and $x=b$. When $R$ is revolved about the $x$-axis, the volume of the resulting solid of revolution is
$$
V=\int_a^b{\pi f(x)^2-\pi g(x)^2}{dx}\text.
$$
## Definition about the $y$-axis
Let $p$ and $q$ be continuous functions with $p(y)\geq q(y)\geq0$ on $[c,d]$. Let $R$ be the region bounded by the curves $x=p(y)$ and $x=q(y)$, and the lines $y=c$ and $y=d$. When $R$ is revolved about the $y$-axis, the volume of the resulting solid of revolution is
$$
V=\int_a^b{\pi p(y)^2-\pi q(y)^2}{dy}\text.
