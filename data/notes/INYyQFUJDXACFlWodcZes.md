- The system is decomposed into classes/objects
- Each class is a major abstraction in the application domain
- Classes can be decomposed into smaller classes

## What is This?

- There are multiple things you can see in this picture
- Designing an OO structure based off the picture is up to your interpretation

- You need to know what problem you're solving!

## Class Identification

- Crucial to OO modeling
- Based assumption:
  1. We can find the classes for a new software system -
     called Greenfield Engineering
  2. We can identify the classes in an existing system -
     called Reengineering
  3. We can create a class-based interface to any system -
     called Interface Engineering

## Object Terminology

### Methodology

- Process for organized production of systems/software
- Using a collection of pre-defined techniques and notational conventions

### Object-Oriented Methodology

- A development approach that organizes a system and collection of objects containing both data and behavior

## OO Concepts

### What is an Object?

- An object has structure- attributes
- An object must be an entity- a thing that can _have_ properties but is not a property
- An object has behavior
- An object has unique identity
- An object is generally stated as a noun
- A thermometer is an object, but temperature is not an object
- [[ser216.introduction.decomposition.object-oriented.briefcase]]

### What is a class?
- A group of objects with
   - Similar properties
   - Common behavior
   - Common relationships to other objects
   - Common semantics
