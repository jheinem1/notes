Functions may be combined using...
- Sums
    - $(f+g)$
- Differences
    - $(f-g)$
- Products
    - $(fg)$
- Quotients
    - $(f/g)$

## Definition
Given two functions $f$ and $g$, the composite function $f \circ g$ is defined by $(f \circ g)(x)=f(g(x))$. It is evaluated in two steps: $y=f(u)$, where $u=g(x)$. The domain of $f \circ g$ consists of all $x$ in the domain of $g$ such that $u=g(x)$ is in the domain of $f$.
