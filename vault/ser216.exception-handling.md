## Motivations

When a program runs into a runtime error, the program terminates abnormally.

The purpose of exception handling is to handle these errors (either continue running or terminate) gracefully.

## Examples

- Examples of exceptions
  - [[ser216.exception-handling.example.quotient]]
  - [[ser216.exception-handling.example.quotient-with-if]]
  - [[ser216.exception-handling.example.quotient-with-exception]]

## Exception Types

### System Errors

- Thrown by JVM and represented in the `Error` class
- This class describes internal system errors, which rarely occur
  - If these errors do occur, handling them is often futile- the operation cannot continue

### Exceptions

- Errors caused by your program and external circumstances
- These can be caught and handled

### Runtime Exceptions

- Caused by programming errors, such as bad casting, accessing an out-of-bounds array index, and numeric errors
- These can generally be eliminated at compile-time and indicate bugs in the underlying program

## Checked Exceptions vs. Unchecked Exceptions

- `RuntimeException`, `Error`, and their subclasses are known as [[unchecked exceptions|ser216.exception-handling.unchecked-exception]]
- All other exceptions are known as [[checked exceptions|ser216.exception-handling.checked-exception]], meaning that the compiler forces the programmer to check and deal with the exceptions

## Declaring, Throwing, and Catching Exceptions

### Declaring exceptions

Every method must state the types of checked exceptions it might throw.

```java
public void myMethod() throws IOException {...}

public void myMethod() throws IOException, OtherException {...}
```

### Throwing Exceptions

Exceptions are thrown by using the `throw` statement and passing a valid `Exception` object.

```java
...
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Radius cannot be negative");
...
```

### Catching Exceptions

Exceptions are caught using a try-catch statement.

```java
try {
    doUnsafeOperation(); // statements that may throw exceptions
} catch (Exception1 e) {
    handleException1();
} catch (Exception2 e) {
    handleException2();
}
```

## Catch or Declare Checked Exceptions

- Java forces you to deal with [[checked exceptions|ser216.exception-handling.checked-exception]]
- If a method declares a [[checked exception|ser216.exception-handling.checked-exception]] (i.e., any exception other than an `Error` or `RuntimeException`), you must invoke it in a try-catch block or declare to throw the exception in the calling method

## Rethrowing Exceptions

```java
try {
    doUnsafeOperation();
} catch (TheException e) {
    performOperationBeforeExiting();
    throw e;
}
```

- The statement `throw e` rethrows the exception `e` so that other handlers get a change to process the exception
- Sometimes you may need to throw a new exception with additional information along with the original exception
  - These is called _chained exceptions_

## The `finally` Clause

```java
try {
    doUnsafeOperation();
} catch (Exception e) {
    handleException();
} finally {
    finalizeOperation();
}
```

^example-error-handling

- Code in the `finally` block is always executed, whether an exception in the `try` block is thrown or not

## Cautions When Using Exceptions

- Exception handling separates error-handling from normal program flow
  - This makes programs easier to read and modify
- However, exception handling usually requires more time and resources
  - It requires instantiating exception objects, rolling back the call stack, and propagating the errors to the calling methods

## When to Throw an Exception

You should throw an exception when...

- An exception occurs in a method
- You want the exception to be handled by the calling method

You should not throw an exception when...

- You can handle the exception in the method where it occurs
- You are dealing with simple, expected situations

## Creating Custom Exceptions

- Use the exception class `Exception` whenever possible
- Create custom exception classes if the pre-defined exception classes do not meet your needs
- Declare custom exception classes by extending the `Exception` class or one of its subclasses

### Examples of Custom Exceptions

- [[ser216.exception-handling.example.invalid-radius-exception]]
- [[ser216.exception-handling.example.circle-with-radius-exception]]
