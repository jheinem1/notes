## Motivations

When a program runs into a runtime error, the program terminates abnormally.

The purpose of exception handling is to handle these errors (either continue running or terminate) gracefully.

## Examples

- Examples of exceptions
    - [[ser216.exception-handling.example.quotient]]
    - [[ser216.exception-handling.example.quotient-with-if]]
    - [[ser216.exception-handling.example.quotient-with-exception]]
- Exception advantages
    - [[ser216.exception-handling.examples.quotient-with-method]]

## Exception Types

### System Errors

- Thrown by JVM and represented in the `Error` class
- This class describes internal system errors, which rarely occur
    - If these errors do occur, handling them is often futile- the operation cannot continue

### Exceptions

- Errors caused by your program and external circumstances
- These can be caught and handled

### Runtime Exceptions

- Caused by programming errors, such as bad casting, accessing an out-of-bounds array index, and numeric errors
- These can generally be eliminated at compile-time and indicate bugs in the underlying program

## Checked Exceptions vs. Unchecked Exceptions

- `RuntimeException`, `Error`, and their subclasses are known as [[unchecked exceptions|ser216.exception-handling.unchecked-exception]]
- All other exceptions are known as [[checked exceptions|ser216.exception-handling.checked-exception]], meaning that the compiler forces the programmer to check and deal with the exceptions

## Declaring, Throwing, and Catching Exceptions

### Declaring exceptions

Every method must state the types of checked exceptions it might throw.

```java
public void myMethod() throws IOException {...}

public void myMethod() throws IOException, OtherException {...}
```

### Throwing Exceptions

Exceptions are thrown by using the `throw` statement and passing a valid `Exception` object.

```java
...
throw new IllegalArgumentException("Radius cannot be negative");
...
```

### Catching Exceptions

Exceptions are caught using a try-catch statement.

```java
try {
    doUnsafeOperation(); // statements that may throw exceptions
} catch (Exception1 e) {
    handleException1();
} catch (Exception2 e) {
    handleException2();
}
```

## Catch or Declare Checked Exceptions

- Java forces you to deal with [[checked exceptions|ser216.exception-handling.checked-exception]]
- If a method declares a [[checked exception|ser216.exception-handling.checked-exception]] (i.e., any exception other than an `Error` or `RuntimeException`), you must invoke it in a try-catch block or declare to throw the exception in the calling method
