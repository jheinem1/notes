Sequences are denoted in the forms

$$
{x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n}\text, \\
{x_n}\text, \\
\text{and }{x_n}_{n=1}^{\infty}\text.
$$

## Limit of a sequence

If the terms of a sequence ${x_n}$ approach a unique number $L$ as $n$ increases (if $a_n$ can be made arbitrarily close to $L$), then the limit $\lim_{n\to\infty} x_n$ **converges** to $L$. If the terms *do not* approach a single number as $n$ increases, the sequence has no limit, and it **diverges**.

A **converging** sequence approaching $0$.

A **diverging** sequence (approaching nothing).

## Infinite series

An infinite series can be viewed as a sum of an infinite set of numbers, with the form

$$
x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n+\cdots\text.
$$

For instance, the infinite series

$$
S_\frac12+\frac14+\frac18+\cdots+\frac{1}{2^n}=\frac{2^n-1}{2^n}
$$

approaches $1$ as $n$ approaches $\infty$.

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}{S_n}=1
$$

## Sequence of partial sums

The sequence of partial sums of a sequence ${S_n}$ is defined as

$$
{S_1, S_2, \ldots, S_n}\text,
$$

where

$$
S_n=x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n\text.
$$

This can be used to evaluate the (infinite) series

$$
\sum_{k=1}^\infty{x_k}
$$

with the limit

$$
\lim_{k\to\infty}{x_k}=\sum_{k=1}^{\infty}{x_k}\text.
$$
