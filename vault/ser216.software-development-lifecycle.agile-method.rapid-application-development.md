## Steps
- Requirements planning phase
    - A workshop utilizing structured discussion of business problems
- User description phase
    - Automated tools capture information from users
- Construction phase
    - Productivity tools
        - Code generators, screen generators, etc.
- Cutover phase
    - Installation of the system
    - User acceptance testing
    - User training
## Strengths
- Reduced cycle time and improved productivity
- Fewer people = fewer costs
- Time-box approach mitigates cost and risk
- Customer involved throughout the complete cycle
- Focus moves from documentation to code ([[WYSIWYG|ser216.what-you-see-is-what-you-get]])
- Uses modeling concepts to capture information about business, data, and processes
## Weaknesses
- Accelerated development process must give quick responses
- Risk of never achieving closure
- Hart to use with legacy systems
- Requires a modularized system
- Developers and customers must be committed to rapid-fire activities
## Use-cases
- Reasonably well-known requirements
- User involved throughout the life-cycle
- Project can be timeboxed
- Functionality delivered in increments
- High performance not required
- Low technical risks
- System can be modularized
