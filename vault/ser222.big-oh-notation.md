Big-Oh notation is a way of quantifying how methods scale based on the size of the data they process. For example, accessing an array is $O(1)$ whereas accessing a linked list is $O(n)$.
^main

## Common functions
- $O(1)$
    - Used for algorithms that always take a fixed amount of time to complete
- $O(\log{n})$
    - Used for algorithms where while the amount of data increases exponentially, the time it takes to complete increases linearly (becomes more efficient with increasing `n` size)
- $O(n)$
    - Used for algorithms that could require iterating over all the data once
- $O(n^2)$
    - Used for algorithms with nested loops
    - The exponent increases based on the number of nested loops
        - $O(n^3)$ could mean 3 nested for loops
    - ```TypeScript
    for (const v0 of iterable)
        for (const v1 of iterable)
            ...
    ```
