- A binary tree is a tree where each node has at most two children.

- A binary search tree is a binary tree where each node's left child has a key that is less than the parent, and the right child has a key that is greater than the parent

## Mapping to an array

Assuming that the tree is complete, we can map the tree to an array by traversing the tree in a breadth-first manner and appending each node's value to the array.

However, if the tree is incomplete, we can still map the tree to an array by adding "null" values to the array for the missing nodes.

Since the tree is mapped in an array, we can access the value of a node using a numeric index.

Given a node `i` in the tree...

- The value of the node at index `i` is `tree[i]`.
- The value of the node's left child is `tree[2 * i]`.
- The value of the node's right child is `tree[2 * i + 1]`.
- The value of the node's parent is `tree[Math.floor(i / 2)]`.
