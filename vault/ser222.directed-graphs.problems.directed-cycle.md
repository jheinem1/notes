[[ser222.directed-graphs.topological-sort]] is not possible of a graph is cyclic. How can we tell if a graph is cyclic?

## Terminology

- A **Directed Acyclic Graph** (DAG) is a graph without any cycles

## Finding cycles

- Cycles can be found in [[ser222.undirected-graphs]] by marking nodes, and this can be applied to directed graphs

## Implementation

```java

public DirectedCycle {
    private boolean[] marked;
    private int[] edgeTo;
    private Stack<Integer> cycle;
    private boolean[] onStack;

    /**
     * Initializes a new directed cycle.
     * @param G the digraph
     */
    public DirectedCycle(Digraph G) {
        onStack = new boolean[G.V()];
        edgeTo = new int[G.V()];
        marked = new boolean[G.V()];
        for (int v = 0; v < G.V(); v++)
            if (!marked[v])
                dfs(G, v);
    }

    private void dfs(Digraph G, int v) {
        onStack[v] = true;
        marked[v] = true;
        for (int w : G.adj(v)) {
            if (cycle != null)
                return;
            else if (!marked[w]) {
                edgeTo[w] = v;
                dfs(G, w);
            } else if (onStack[w]) {
                cycle = new Stack<Integer>();
                for (int x = v; x != w; x = edgeTo[x])
                    cycle.push(x);
                cycle.push(w);
                cycle.push(v);
            }
        }
        onStack[v] = false;
    }

    /**
     * Detects whether the digraph has a directed cycle.
     * @return {@code true} if the digraph has a directed cycle, {@code false} otherwise
     */
    public boolean hasCycle() {
        return cycle != null;
    }

    /**
     * If possible, finds the vertices on a directed cycle.
     * @return the vertices on a directed cycle as an {@link Iterable}, or {@code null} if there is no such cycle
     */
    public Iterable<Integer> cycle() {
        return cycle;
    }
}
