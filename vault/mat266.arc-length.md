## Definition for $y=f(x)$
Let $f$ have a continuous first derivative on the interval $[a,b]$. The length of the curve from $(a,f(a))$ to $(b,f(b))$ is
$$
L=\int_a^b{\sqrt{q+f\prime(x)^2}}{dx}\text.
$$

## Definition for $x=g(y)$
Let $x=g(y)$ have a continuous first derivative on the interval $[c,d]$. The length of the curve from $(g(c), c)$ to $(g(d), d)$ is
$$
L=\int_x^d{\sqrt{1+g\prime(y)^2}}{dy}\text.
