An infinite series can be viewed as a sum of an infinite set of numbers, with the form

$$
x_1+x_2+\cdots+x_n+\cdots\text.
$$

For instance, the infinite series

$$
S_\frac12+\frac14+\frac18+\cdots+\frac{1}{2^n}=\frac{2^n-1}{2^n}
$$

approaches $1$ as $n$ approaches $\infty$.

$$
\lim_{n\to\infty}{S_n}=1
$$
