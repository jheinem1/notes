A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

For example, a recipe for a pizza.

## Characterizing algorithms
### Understanding programs
- Suppose you managed to obtain an internship at a coveted company
- Unfortunately the company has brought in several interns but only has one position
- As part of your work, you are asked to write an algorithm to solve a problem
- At the end you need to present your solution and demonstrate how it is better
    - There is no way to argue one implementation vs another!
- We need a way to categorize the algorithms
### Terminology
#### P & NP
- `NP != P`?
- `P` represents a possible range values `n` could be and still be computed in a reasonable amount of time
- `NP` represents a possible range of values `n` could *not* be and still be completed
- Continues into `P SPACE`, `EXP SPACE`, etc.  
- The highest complexity problem is the halting problem, where it's impossible to write a program to determine whether another (Turing complete) program loops infinitely
#### Problem Size
- `n` is typically used as a variable when dealing with problem size
    - Could be...
        - Size of an array (search/sorting)
        - Value of integer (factorial)
        - Length of a string (reverse/copying)
#### Growth function
- Computes the number of operations for an implementation to execute on a problem of size `n`
- May be written as $f(n)$, $t(n)$, etc.
    - $f(n)=1$
        - A method that always executes one operation
    - $f(n)=1+n$
        - A method that performs a fixed operation and then an operation that depends on the problem size

## Analytical analysis
### Defining $F(N)$
- We are better off thinking in terms of a specific ***cost*** metric
- Our cost should probably measure the most "expensive" or "frequent" operation
- ```java
  boolean searchBinary(int target, int[] pool) {
      int lo = 0;
      int hi = pool.length - 1;
      while (lo <= hi) {
          int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2; // should measure here
          if (target < pool[mid])
              hi = mid - 1;
          else if (target > pool[mid])
              lo = mid + 1;
          else
              return true;
      }
      return false;
  }
  ```
    - The ideal place to measure would be the `int mid`

### Analysis of Threesum
```java
//Sedgewick and Wayne
public static int threeSum(int[] a) {
    int N = a.length;
    int count = 0;
    for (int i = 0; i < N; i++)
        for (int j = i+1; j < N; j++)
            for (int k = j+1; k < N; k++)
                if (a[i] + a[j] + a[k] == 0)
                    count++;
        return count;
    }
}
```
- For our cost model, we will count the number of comparisons with `0`
- $\sum^N_{i=1}{(\sum^N_{j=i+1}{(\sum^N_{k=j+1}{1})})}$
- Methods
    - Can write it out and try to find a pattern
        - $\sum^N_{i=1}{(\sum^N_{j=i+1}{(\sum^N_{k=j+1}{1})})}\approx\int^N_{x=1}{(\int^N_{y=x}{(\int^N_{z=y}{dz})}{dy})}{dx}\approx\frac{1}{6}N^3$
    - Use tables of summation formulas
    - Use a CAS (pls just do this)
        - ![](/assets/images/2022-02-02-11-12-48.png)
- Sometimes the answer will be messy- it can be fair game to modify the bounds to get a more reasonable solution
### Input dependence
- Is it possible to write a growth function for an algorithm that isn't necessarily dictated by $n$
```java
boolean searchLinear(int target, int[] pool) {
    for (int i = 0; i < pool.length; i++)
        if (pool[i] == target)
            return true;
    return false;
}
```
- Let's assume the inputs of size $k$ are sorted starting with the most sorted inputs
- Although some methods lack direct dependence on input character, others are influenced
- On a nearly sorted input, insertion sort will behave more linearly than quadratically
## Recurrences
- So far, we haven't looked at any methods that call themselves
- This is where things get tricky (just kidding, not really)
- Any algorithm written linearly can be written recursively and vice-versa
