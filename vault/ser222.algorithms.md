A process or set of rules to be followed in calculations or other problem-solving operations, especially by a computer.

For example, a recipe for a pizza.

## Characterizing algorithms
### Understanding programs
- Suppose you managed to obtain an internship at a coveted company
- Unfortunately the company has brought in several interns but only has one position
- As part of your work, you are asked to write an algorithm to solve a problem
- At the end you need to present your solution and demonstrate how it is better
    - There is no way to argue one implementation vs another!
- We need a way to categorize the algorithms
### Terminology
#### P & NP
- `NP != P`?
- `P` represents a possible range values `n` could be and still be computed in a reasonable amount of time
- `NP` represents a possible range of values `n` could *not* be and still be completed
- Continues into `P SPACE`, `EXP SPACE`, etc.  
- The highest complexity problem is the halting problem, where it's impossible to write a program to determine whether another (Turing complete) program loops infinitely
#### Problem Size
- `n` is typically used as a variable when dealing with problem size
    - Could be...
        - Size of an array (search/sorting)
        - Value of integer (factorial)
        - Length of a string (reverse/copying)
#### Growth function
- Computes the number of operations for an implementation to execute on a problem of size `n`
- May be written as $f(n)$, $t(n)$, etc.
    - $f(n)=1$
        - A method that always executes one operation
    - $f(n)=1+n$
        - A method that performs a fixed operation and then an operation that depends on the problem size

## Analysis approaches
### Analytical approach
```Java
int pool = new int[n];
for (int i = 0; i < pool.length; i++)
    pool[i] = random.nextInt(100);
```
$$
f(n)=1+((1)+(n+1)+(n)+(n))=3+3n
$$
Provides a more exact equation, but takes longer.
