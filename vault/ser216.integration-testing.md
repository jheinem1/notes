## Concept

- The entire system is viewed as a collection of subsystems determined during design
- The goal of integration testing is to test all interfaces between subsystems and the interaction of subsystems
- The integration testing strategy determined the order in which the subsystems are tested

## Why integration testing?

- Unit tests only test in isolation
- Many failures result from faults in the interaction of subsystems
    - "Integration hell" is one of the longest stages of debugging
- Failures not discovered in integration testing may not be discovered until the system is deployed

## Stubs & drivers

### Driver

- A component that calls the `TestedUnit`
- Controls test cases

### Stub

- A component the `TestedUnit` depends on
- Partial implementation
- Returns fake values

## Integration testing strategies

- [[ser216.integration-testing.big-bang]]
- [[ser216.integration-testing.bottom-up]]
- [[ser216.integration-testing.top-down]]
- [[ser216.integration-testing.sandwich]]
- [[ser216.integration-testing.continuous]]

## Steps

1. Select a component to be tested an unit test it
2. Put the component together with any necessary drivers and stubs
3. Test functional requirements
4. Test subsystem decomposition
5. Test non-functional requirements
6. Keep records of test cases
7. Repeat steps 1-7 until full system is tested
