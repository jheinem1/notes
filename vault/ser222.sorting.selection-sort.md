Finds the smallest element in the data, swaps it for the position `i`, then repeats for all elements in the list.

This forms a region in the front of the list that is fully sorted

Selection sort performs best with random inputs, and is less efficient with partially sorted inputs.

## Steps
1. Find the smallest element in the data, starting at position `i`
2. Swap it with the position `i`
3. Repeat for all of `n` (elements in the list)

## Implementation
(assuming `less` and `exh` defined)
```java
public static void selectionSort(Comparable[] array) {
    for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++) {
        // exchange array[i] with the smallest entry in array[i + 1...array.length]
        int min = i;
        for (int j = i + 1; j < array.length; j++)
            if (less(array[j], array[min]))
                min = j;
        exch(array, i, min);
    }
}
```
