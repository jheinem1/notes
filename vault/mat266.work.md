The change in energy when a force causes a displacement of an object. For example, carrying a refrigerator up a flight of stairs.

If a *constant* force $F$ displaces an object a distance $d$ in the direction of the force, the work done is $\text{work}=\text{force}*\text{distance}$.

Calculus deals with **variable** forces:

## Definition
The work done by a variable force $F$ in moving an object along a line from $x=a$ to $x=b$ in the direction of the force is
$$
W=\int_a^b{F(x)}{dx}\text.
$$

## Lifting problems

The work required to lift this chain is
$$
W=\int_0^L{\rho g(L-y)}{dy}
$$
$L$ is the distance to be lifted, $\rho$ is the [[mat266.mass]] of the object, and $g$ represents gravity.

($g$ being gravity is almost always $9.8$)

## Pumping problems
Suppose a fluid such as water is pumped out of a tank to a height $h$ above the bottom of the tank. How much work is required, assuming the tank is full of water?

### Procedure
1. Draw a $y$-axis in the vertical direction
2. For $a\leq y\leq b$, find the cross-sectional area $A(y)$ of the horizontal slices and the distance $D(y)$ the slices must be lifted
3. The work required to lift the water is
$$
W=\int_a^b{\rho gA(y)D(y)}{dy}\text.
$$
### Example

The resulting integral is
$$
W=\int_0^10{\rho gA(y)D(y)}{dy}
$$
$$
A(y)=\pi r^2=\pi 5^2=25\pi
$$
$$
D(y)=15-y
$$
$$
W=\int_0^10{*\rho*(9.8)*(25\pi)(15-y)*}{dy}
$$
$$
=25\pi\rho(9.8)\int_0^10{(15-y)}{dy}
$$
