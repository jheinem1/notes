## Client-server communication

- The server is always running, and can have multiple clients connected to it.
- The client connects to a socket on the server.
- After a server accepts the communication, data is transferred through I/O streams (in Java) or sockets (in C)

## Data transmission through sockets

### Server

```java
int port = 8000;
DataInputStream in;
DataOutputStream out;
ServerSocket server;
Socket socket;

server = new ServerSocket(port);
socket = server.accept(); // accept connection request from client
in = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());

System.out.println(in.readDouble()); // wait for data from client
out.writeDouble(3.14); // send data to client
```

### Client

```java
int port = 8000;
String host = "localhost";
DataInputStream in;
DataOutputStream out;
Socket socket;

socket = new Socket(host, port);
in = new DataInputStream(socket.getInputStream());
out = new DataOutputStream(socket.getOutputStream());

out.writeDouble(3.14); // send data to server
System.out.println(in.readDouble()); // wait for data from server
```

## The InetAddress class

The `InetAddress` class can be used to find the IP address and host name of a client.

To get the `InetAddress` of a client, use the `getInetAddress()` method on the socket.

```java
InetAddress address = socket.getInetAddress();
```

The `InetAddress` returned will contain the host name and IP address of the client as demonstrated below.

```java
Syste.out.println(address.getHostName());
System.out.println(address.getHostAddress());
```

## Handling multiple clients

Multiple clients are generally handled with some sort of loop or a thread pool.

```java
while (true) {
    Socket socket = server.accept();
    HandleTask task = new HandleTask(socket);
    Thread thread = new Thread(task);
    thread.start();
}
```

The above will create a new thread for each connected client.
