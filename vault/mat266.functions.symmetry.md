## Definition
- A graph is **symmetric with respect to the y-axis** if whenever the point $(x,y)$ is on the graph, the point $(-x,y)$ is also on the graph. 
    - This means that the graph is unchanged when reflected on the y-axis.
    - A function symmetric across the y-axis is an **even function**.

- A graph is **symmetric with respect to the x-axis** if whenever the point $(x,y)$ is on the graph, the point $(x,-y)$ is also on the graph. 
    - This means that the graph is unchanged when reflected on the x-axis.

- A graph is **symmetric with respect to the origin** if whenever the point $(x,y)$ is on the graph, the point $(-x,-y)$ is also on the graph. 
    - This means that the graph is unchanged when reflected across the origin (also means the graph is symmetrical across both the x and y axes).
    - A function symmetric across the origin is an **odd function**.

## Determining the Symmetry of a Function
- A function that consists of only even powers is an even function ($x^0$ is considered an even power).
- A function that consists of both even and odd powers is neither odd nor even.
- A function that consists of only odd powers is considered an odd function (again, $x^0$ is considered an even power).
