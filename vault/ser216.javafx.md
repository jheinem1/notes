## Motivations

- JavaFX is a framework for developing Java GUI programs
- JavaFX utilizes OOP principles in its design

## JavaFX vs Swing and AWT

- AWT
    - Fine for developing simple interfaces
    - Not suited for cross-platform development
    - Replaced largely by Swing
- Swing
    - Allows for painting, layout, and event handling
    - Relies less on native GUI
    - Replaced by JavaFX in Java 8

## Basic Structure

- Application
- `start(Stage)` method
- Stage, scene, and nodes

## Panes, UI controls, and shapes

- Shapes such as line, circle, ellipse, rectangle, path, etc. are subclasses of `Shape`
- `ImageView` used for displaying images
- UI controls are subclasses of `Control`

## Coordinate system

- JavaFX uses a coordinate system with the origin at the top left corner
- This means that to draw a circle in the center of a 500x500 pixel area, you would need to create a circle with the center at (250, 250)

## Binding properties

- Enable a target object to be bound to a source object
- If the value in the source object changes, the target property is also changed
- The target object is simply called a binding object or binding property

## Common properties and methods

### Style

- Set a JavaFX CSS style

### Rotate
 
- Rotate a node

### Color

- `new Color(r, g, b, a)`

### Font

- `new Font(nname, weight, size)`

### Image

- `new Image(fileOrURL)`
