Java is a class-based, OO (Object-Oriented) language.

## Classes
Everything in Java is wrapped by a class...
```Java
public class App {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        System.out.println("Hello World!");
    }
}
```
...including the code necescarry for a "Hello World!" print to console.

There can only be one public class for file (public means the class is exported and can be imported by other files), but there can be as many private classes in a file as necessary.
```Java
public class App { ... }

class Other { ... }
class Another { ... }
```
Fields and methods can be either public or private and either static or non-static.

Public fields are accessible from outside the class/object
```Java
var myObject = new ClassName();
myObject.method();
System.out.println(myObject.field);
```
, whereas private fields are only accessible from within the object;
```Java
class ClassName {
    private int field;
    public ClassName(int field) {
        this.field = field;
    }
}
```
Similarly (but also very differently), static fields an methods are only accessible on the base class and not any objects and vice-versa for non-static fields and methods.
## Variables
Variables are declared and initialized with the syntax `Type varName = new Type(...);`, assuming the variable is being initialized as an object.
## References
There are no pointer types in Java, however all objects are stored as references. This means otherwise identical objects cannot be compared without specific methods or overloads to do so.
```Java
String string0 = "Hello World!";
String string1 = "Hello World!";
System.out.println(string0 == string1); // false
```
(Unlike other languages, strings are considered objects in Java)
