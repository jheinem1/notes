## Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes are a framework for creating objects that defines the data and behavior they contain
- Classes are instanced to create objects
- Objects are characterized by...
    - State
    - Behavior
    - Identity
## Reference Representation
- When a variable is created, it will store the data that represents the number
- In contrast, *object* variables do not contain the data representing the object, just a reference to the object
- Hence, object values are always references
```Java
int value = 5;
Counter c1 = new Counter("First");
```
(very simplified)

0x00|...
|-|-|
0x01|5
0x02|0x04
0x02|0x04
0x03|...
0x04|"First
0x05|0
## Counter Class
```Java
//from Sedgewick and Wayne
public class Counter {
    private final String name; // counter name
    private int count = 0; // current value
    public Counter(String id) {
        name = id;
    }
    public void increment() {
        count++;
    }
    public int tally() {
        return count;
    }
    public String toString() {
        return count + " " + name;
    }
}
```
## "Common" Methods
- All classes in Java are a subclass of `Object`
- `Object` contains several methods (such as toString) that can be overwridden to give a tighter integration with existing functionality
