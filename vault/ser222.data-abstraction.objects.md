## Object-Oriented Programming
- Classes are a framework for creating objects that defines the data and behavior they contain
- Classes are instanced to create objects
- Objects are characterized by...
    - State
    - Behavior
    - Identity
## Reference Representation
- When a variable is created, it will store the data that represents the number
- In contrast, *object* variables do not contain the data representing the object, just a reference to the object
- Hence, object values are always references
```Java
int value = 5;
Counter c1 = new Counter("First");
```
(very simplified)

0x00|...
|-|-|
0x01|5
0x02|0x04
0x02|0x04
0x03|...
0x04|"First
0x05|0
