Simson's rule is a numerical method of integration, used to evaluate definite integrals. Usually to evaluate these integrals, the [[mat266.fundamental-theorem]] of calculus is used, however sometimes it can be too difficult to use by hand.

## Formula

$$
\int_a^b{f(x)}\,dx\approx S_n=\frac{x}{3}(f(x_0)+4f(x_1))+2f(x_2)+4+\ldots+2f(x_{n-2})+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_n))\text,
$$
where $n$ is an even number, $x=\frac{(b-a)}{n}$ and $x_i=a+ix$.
