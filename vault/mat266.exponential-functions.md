Exponential functions have the form $f(x)=b^x$ , where the base $b\ne1$ is a positive real number. Closely associated with exponential functions are logarithmic functions of the form $f(x)=\log_b{x}$ , where $b\gt0$ and $b\ne1$ . An exponential function has a domain consisting of all real numbers. Logarithmic functions are defined for positive real numbers

The natural exponential function is $f(x)=e^x$ , with base $b=e$ , where $e\approx2.71828â€¦$ is one of the fundamental constants of mathematics. Associated with the natural exponential function is the natural logarithm function $f(x)=\ln{x}$ , which also has the base $b=e$ .

Radicals are equivalent to exponents, e.g. $16^{\frac{3}{4}}=(\sqrt[4]{16})^3$.
