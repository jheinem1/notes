**Engineering** is the systematic application of scientific knowledge in creating and building cost-effective solutions to practical problems.

**Software Engineering** is a collection of techniques, methodologies, and tools that help with the production of...

- A high quality software system
- With a given budget
- Before a given deadline

...while a change occurs.

However, these rarely happen. Software production has a [[poor track record|ser216.introduction.space-shuttle-software]].
## Problem-Solving
To problem-solve, we [[analyze|ser216.introduction.analysis]] and [[synthesize|ser216.introduction.synthesis]] using...
- [[ser216.introduction.techniques]]
- [[ser216.introduction.methodologies]]
- [[ser216.introduction.tools]]

## Why are software systems so complex?
- The problem domain is difficult
- The development process is very difficult to manage
- Software offers extreme flexibility
## How do software engineers deal with complexity?
