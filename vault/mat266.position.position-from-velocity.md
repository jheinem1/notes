Given the velocity $v$ of an object moving along a line and its initial position $s(0)$, the position function of the object for future times $t\geq0$ is
$$
s(t)=s(0)+\int^t_0{v(x)}{\text{ }dx}\text{.}
$$

There are two equivalent ways to determine the position function- antiderivatives and the above theorem, the latter generally being more efficient.

## Example
A block hangs at rest from a massless spring at the origin $s=0$. At $t=0$, the block is pulled downward $\frac{1}{4}\text{m}$ to its initial position $s(0)=-\frac{1}{4}$ and released.

Its velocity in $\text{m/s}$ is given by $v(t)=\frac{1}{4}\sin{t}$, for $t\geq0$. Assume the upward direction is positive.
### Find the position of the block, for $t\geq0$
The velocity function is positive for $0<t<\pi$, which means the block moves in the positive (upward) direction.

At $t=\pi$, the block comes to rest momentarily; for $\pi<t<2\pi$, the block moves in the negative (downward) direction.

We let $s(t)$ be the position at time $t\geq0$ with the initial position $s(0)=-\frac14\text{m}$

Using the theorem (antiderivatives can also be used), we may use the relationship
$$
s(t)=s(0)+\int^t_0{v(x)}{\text{ }dx}\text.
$$
Substituting $v(x)=\frac14\sin{x}$ and $s(0)=-\frac14$, the position function is
$$
s(t)=-\frac14+\int^t_0{\frac14\sin{x}}{\text{ }dx}
$$
$$
=-\frac14\cos{t}\text.
$$

### When does the block moves through the origin for the first time?
The block initially moves in the positive $s$ direction, reaching the origin $s=0$ when $s(t)=-\frac14\cos{t}=0$.

So, the block arrives at the origin for the first time when $t=\frac\pi2$,

Graphing can help visualize this.
### When does the block reach its highest point for the first time, and what is the position at that time?
The block moves in the positive direction and reaches its high point for the first time when $t=\pi$ (which is $s(\pi)=\frac14\text{m}$), and this motion repeats every $2\pi$ seconds.
