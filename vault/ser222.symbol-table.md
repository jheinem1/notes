## Extending arrays

- In an array, an index corresponds to some value
- It would be useful to extend this idea
    - Mapping any type of key to values
- This is a symbol table
    -  Insert: `put(K, V)`
        - Associates a key with a value
    - Search: `get(K)`
        - Returns the value associated with the key
        - If no value is associated with the key, returns `null`
- Symbol tables are often implemented as **Dictionaries**, **Hash Tables**, or **Maps**

## API

```java
public interface SymbolTable<K, V> {
    /**
     * Put key-value pair into the symbol table.
     * @param key the key
     * @param val the value
     * @return the previous value associated with key, or {@code null} if there was no mapping for key.
    */
    void put(K key, V value);
    /**
     * Get the value associated with the given key.
     * @param key the key
     * @return the value associated with the given key if present, or {@code null} if no value is present.
    */
    V get(K key);
    /**
     * Remove the key (and its associated value) from the symbol table.
     * @param key the key
     * @return the value associated with the given key if present, or {@code null} if no value is present.
    */
    void delete(K key);
    /**
     * Does the symbol table contain the given key?
     * @return {@code true} if the symbol table is empty, {@code false} otherwise
    */
    boolean contains(K key);
    /**
     * Is the symbol table empty?
     * @return {@code true} if the symbol table is empty, {@code false} otherwise
    */
    boolean isEmpty();
    /**
     * Return the number of key-value mappings in the symbol table.
     * @return the number of key-value mappings in the symbol table
    */
    int size();
    /**
     * Return all keys in the symbol table as an {@code Iterable}.
     * To iterate over all of the keys in the symbol table named {@code st},
     * use the foreach notation: {@code for (Key key : st.keys())}.
     * @return all keys in the symbol table as an {@code Iterable}
    */
    Iterable<K> keys();
}
```

- A key *cannot* refer to multiple values withing

## Applications in compilers

- As a standard part of most compilers, a symbol table of variables is built
- The compiler indexes each variable in a method and uses it as a key to store the assigned value

```java
void compute_z() {
    int x = 2;
    int y = x + 5;
    int z = (y + x) * 2;
    System.out.println(z);
}
```

Variable | Value
-------- | -----
x        | Constant: 2
y        | Expr: x + 5
z        | Expr: (y + x) * 2
