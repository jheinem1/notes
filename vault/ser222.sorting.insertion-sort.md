Insertion Sort works by creating a sorted, but not final section up to the position `j` in an array. Unlike [[ser222.sorting.selection-sort]], Insertion Sort has a best-case-scenario of $\Omega(n)$ sorting time.

Insertion sort performs best with partially sorted inputs, and worst with reversed inputs.

One of the "benefits" of insertion sort is that the sorted region is always 1 or greater elements- even before the algorithm starts.1
## Steps
1. Pick some element at position `j`
2. Insert the element into the sorted position in the sorted region
3. Repeat for all elements in the list

## Implementation
```java
public static void sort(Comparable[] array) {
    for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++)
        for (int j = 1; j > 0 && less(a[j], a[j-1]); j--)
            exch(a, j, j - 1);
}
```
