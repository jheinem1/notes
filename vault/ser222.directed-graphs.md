- Essentially [[ser222.undirected-graphs]], but with edges that have a clearly defined direction
    - ![](/assets/images/2022-04-20-10-35-02.png)
- Interestingly, these can be used for things like crafting recipes in games, where materials have to exist in a certain order relative to each other

## Terminology

- `V` is a **Direct Predecessor** of `W` if there is a path/edge from `V` to `W`
- `V` is a **Direct Successor** of `W` if there is a path/edge from `W` to `V`
- `V` is a **Predecessor** of `W` if `V` is a direct predecessor of `W` or a predecessor of a direct predecessor of `W`
- `V` is a **Successor** of `W` if `V` is a direct successor of `W` or a successor of a direct successor of `W`

## Directed graph ADT

```java
public interface Diagraph {
    int V(); // number of vertices
    int E(); // number of edges
    void addEdge(int v, int w); // add edge v->w
    Iterable<Integer> adj(int v); // vertices connected to v from edges v->x
    Digraph reverse(); // reverse of digraph
    String toString(); // string representation of digraph
}
```

## Implementation

```java
public class DigraphImplementation implements Digraph {
    private final int V;
    private int E;
    private LinkedList<Integer>[] adj;

    /**
     * Initializes an empty digraph with `V` vertices.
     * @param V the number of vertices
     */
    public Digraph(int V) {
        this.V = V;
        this.E = 0;
        adj = (LinkedList<Integer>[]) new LinkedList[V];
        for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)
            adj[v] = new LinkedList<Integer>();
    }

    /**
     * Reads a digraph from an input stream.
     * @param in the input stream
     */
    public Digraph(In in) {
        this(in.readInt());
        int E = in.readInt();
        for (int i = 0; i < E; i++) {
            int v = in.readInt();
            int w = in.readInt();
            addEdge(v, w);
        }
    }

    /**
     * Returns the number of vertices in the digraph.
     * @return the number of vertices in the digraph
     */
    public int V() {
        return V;
    }

    /**
     * Returns the number of edges in the digraph.
     * @return the number of edges in the digraph
     */
    public int E() {
        return E;
    }

    /**
     * Adds the directed edge v->w to the digraph.
     * @param v the tail vertex
     * @param w the head vertex
     */
    public void addEdge(int v, int w) {
        adj[v].add(w);
        E++;
    }

    /**
     * Returns the vertices adjacent from vertex `v` in the digraph.
     * @param v the vertex
     * @return the vertices adjacent from vertex `v` in the digraph
     */
    public Iterable<Integer> adj(int v) {
        return adj[v];
    }

    /**
     * Returns the reverse of the digraph.
     * @return the reverse of the digraph
     */
    public Digraph reverse() {
        Digraph r = new DigraphImplementation(V);
        for (int v = 0; v < V; v++)
            for (int w : adj(v))
                r.addEdge(w, v);
        return r;
    }
}
```

## Sorting

[[Topological Sorting|ser222.directed-graphs.topological-sort]] is a common method to produce ordered graphs.
