Integrals of the for $\int{\tan^m{x}\sec^n{x}}\,dx$ are evaluated using methods analogous to those used for $\int{\sin^m{x}}\,dx$.

For example, if $n$ is an even positive integer, we split off a factor of $\sec^2{x}$ and write the remaining even power of $\sec{x}$ in terms of $\tan{x}$. If $m$ is odd, we split off a factor of $\sec{x}\tan{x}$, which prepares the integral for the substitution $u=\sec{x}$. If $m$ is even and $n$ is odd, the integrand is expressed as a polynomial in $\sec{x}$, each of whose terms are handled by a [[reduction formula|mat266.trigonometric-integrals.reduction-formulas]].
