Arguing and supporting a proposed solution against alternatives. We often *want* to be right all the time. An argument which supports your design as being superior to other potential designs which also satisfy the analysis requirements.

  1. Well-founded, sound, and solved the problem
  2. Is the optimal design for the problem
