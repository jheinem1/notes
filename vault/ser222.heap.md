- A heap is a data structure that is a complete [[ser222.binary-tree]]
- A binary tree is *heap-ordered* if each node is larger than or equal to the keys in its left and right subtrees
- This means the largest element is always at the root of the tree in a max heap
    - This can be reversed for a min heap

**This assumes that the heap is a max heap.**

## Array mapping

- Although the tree could be represented as a linked structure, we can use an array to represent the tree
    - This makes it easier to implement the heap operations
- A complete binary tree is one where every level is full except for the last level
- This will make accessing other nodes fast

## Heap operations

### Swim

- Suppose we insert a new element `k` into the heap
    - This element could be larger than its parent
- We need to "swim" the element up to its correct position

```java
private void swim(int k) {
    while (k > 1 && less(k / 2, k)) {
        exch(k, k / 2);
        k = k / 2;
    }
}
```

### Sink

- Suppose we insert a new element 'k' into the heap
    - This element could be smaller than its children
- We need to "sink" the element down to its correct position

```java
private void sink(int k) {
    while (2 * k <= N) {
        int j = 2 * k;
        if (j < N && less(j, j + 1)) j++;
        if (!less(k, j)) break;
        exch(k, j);
        k = j;
    }
}
```
