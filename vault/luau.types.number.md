A luau number can be either a `float` or an `integer`, but both are represented by the same type. Luau uses both 32-bit and 64-bit numbers depending on the origin of the number.

## Manipulation

- `+`: Addition
- `-`: Subtraction
- `*`: Multiplication
- `/`: Division
- `%`: Modulo
- `^`: Exponentiation

For bitwise operations, see [[luau.globals.bit32]].
