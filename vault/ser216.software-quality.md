## What is quality

- Meeting the user's needs
    - Not wants
- Hierarchy of needs
    - Performs the required tasks
    - Meets performance requirements
    - Usable and convenient
    - Economical and timely
    - Reliable
- Defects are not important to users unless they...
    - Affect operations
    - Cause inconvenience
    - Waste time/money
    - Cause loss of confidence

## Defect-removal methods

- Testing alone is not an effective method to remove defects
- The principle way to fix defects are...
    - Compiling
    - Unit testing
        - Effective at ensuring that the code meets basic requirements
        - Not efficient when finding bugs in applications with variable input/state
    - Integration testing
    - Team inspections
    - Personal reviews
        - Privately reviewing the product
        - Effective when structured & measured
        - More efficient than testing

### Design review

- Produce designs that can be reviewed in stages
1. Review against the requirements to ensure the required function is addressed by the design
2. Verify the overall program structure and flow
3. Check the logical constructs for correctness
4. Check for robustness, safety, and security
5. Check the function, method, and procedure calls to ensure proper use
6. Check special variables, parameters, types, and files for proper use

## Defect prevention

- Defect prevention should follow an orderly strategy and defined process
    - This includes gathering data, improving design methods, and prototyping
- Set priorities for defects that are most...
    - Frequently found
    - Troublesome
    - Easily prevented
    - Annoying
