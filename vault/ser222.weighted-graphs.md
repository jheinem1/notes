Weighted graphs assign a weight to each edge rather than just a boolean value. This takes up more space, but allows for more realistic graphs.

## Edges with attributes

- We will create a simple class to hold the attributes of each edge

```java
public class DirectedEdge {
    private final int v;
    private final int w;
    private final double weight;

    public DirectedEdge(int v, int w, double weight) {
        this.v = v;
        this.w = w;
        this.weight = weight;
    }

    public double weight() {
        return weight;
    }

    public int from() {
        return v;
    }

    public int to() {
        return w;
    }

    public String toString() {
        return String.format("%d->%d %.2f", v, w, weight);
    }
}
```

## Revisiting directed graph ADT

- There are some small modifications to the [[Directed Graph|ser222.directed-graphs]] that we will make to make it work with weighted edges

```java
public interface EdgeWeightedGraph {
    int V(); // number of vertices
    int E(); // number of edges
    void addEdge(DirectedEdge e); // add edge v->w
    Iterable<DirectedEdge> adj(int v); // vertices connected to v from edges v->x
    Iterable<DirectedEdge> edges(); // all edges
    String toString(); // string representation of graph
}
```

## Concepts

- A path between two nodes is the shortest if there is no other path with a smaller weight
