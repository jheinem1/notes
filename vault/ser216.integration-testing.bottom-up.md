- The subsystems in the lowest layer of the hierarchy are tested individually
- Then, the next subsystems that depend on the subsystems in the lowest layer are tested
- This is repeated until all subsystems are combined into a single system
- Drivers are responsible for performing the integration testing

## Advantages

- No stubs needed
- Useful for integration testing of...
    - Object-oriented systems
    - Real-time systems
    - Systems with strict performance requirements

## Disadvantages

- Tests the most important subsystem last (user interface)
- Requires a *lot* of drivers
