- Non-proprietary standard for modeling software systems
- Convergence of notations
    - OMT
    - Booch
    - OOSE
- Current version: UML 2.5
- Commercial tools
    - Rational
    - Together
    - Visual Architect
- Open-source tools
    - ArgoUML
    - StarUML
    - Umbrello

## Modeling with UML
- You can model 80% of problems using about 20% of UML
### [[ser216.uml.diagrams.use-case]]
### Class diagrams
- Describe the static structure of the system
- Composed of...
    - Objects
    - Attributes
    - Associations
### Sequence diagrams
- Describe the dynamic behavior between objects of the system
### State-chart diagrams
- Describe the dynamic behavior of an individual object
## Activity diagrams
- Describe the dynamic behavior of a system

## Building Blocks
The building blocks of UML are [[ser216.uml.things]], [[ser216.uml.relationships]], and [[ser216.uml.diagrams]].
