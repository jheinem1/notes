## Extra things

### Harmonic Series

The harmonic series

$$
\sum_{n=1}^{\infty} \frac1n = \frac{1}{1} + \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \cdots
$$

has the limit `0` as `n` approaches infinity, however it does **not** converge, it diverges.

### Average value

The average value of $f(x)$ over the range $a$-$b$ is

$$
\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b{f(x)}\,dx
$$

### Equality

$0.999999999...=1$
