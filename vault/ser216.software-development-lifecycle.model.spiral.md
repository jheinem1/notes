- Adds risk analysis and RAD prototyping to the waterfall model
- Each cycle involves the same sequence of steps as the waterfall process model
## Steps
### Determine objectives, alternatives, and constraints
- Objectives
    - Functionality, performance, hardware/software interface, success factors, etc.
- Alternatives
    - Build, reuse, buy, subcontract, etc.
- Constraints
    - Cost, schedule, interface, etc.
### Evaluate alternatives, identify, and resolve risks
- Study alternatives relative to objectives and constraints
- Identify risks
- Resolve risks
### Develop next-level product
- Typical activities
    - Create a design
    - Review design
    - Develop code
    - Inspect code
    - Test product  
### Plan next phase
- Typical activities
    - Develop project plan
    - Develop configuration management plan
    - Develop test plan
    - Develop installation plan
## Strengths
- Provides early indication of insurmountable risks without much cost
- Users see the system early because of prototyping
- Critical high-risk functions are developed first
- The design can be flawed
- Users can be closely tied to all lifecycle steps
- Early and frequent feedback from users
- Cumulative costs assessed frequently
## Deficiencies
- Time spent for evaluating risks too large for small or low-risk projects
- Time spent planning may be excessive
- The model is complex
- Risk assessment expertise is required
- Spiral may continue indefinitely
- Developers must be reassigned during non-development phase activities
- May be hard to define milestones that indicate readiness
## Use-cases
- When creation of a prototype is appropriate
- When costs and risk evaluation is important
- For medium to high-risk projects
- Long-term project commitment unwise because of potential changes to economic priorities
- Users unsure of needs
- Requirements are complex
- New product line
- Significant changes are expected
