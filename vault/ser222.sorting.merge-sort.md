## The algorithm

- Realistically, you would not use algorithms like [[ser222.sorting.selection-sort]] or other $O(n^2)$
- [[ser222.sorting.insertion-sort]] still has some benefits, but is not widely used

### Divide-and-conquer algorithms

- In a divide-and-conquer, an algorithm is designed to divide a problem into a set of sub-problems, repeating until a trivial problem emerges, and then combine the results of the sub-problems to give a solution to the original problem
- This often gives an algorithm's complexity $\log{n}$- this represents the performing a reduction on the input size

## The concept

- Take an array, then split it into halves
- Sort each of the halves (using recursion (though you don't have to))
- Combine the sorted halves to form a sorted whole

## Implementation

```java
public static void mergeSort(Comparable[] array) {
    Comparable[] aux = new comparable[array.length];
    sort(a, aux, 0, a.length - 1);

    assert isSorted(a);
}

private static void mergeSort(Comparable[] array, Comparable[] aux, int lo, int hi) {
    if (hi <= lo)
        return;
    
    int mid = lo + (hi - lo) / 2;
    
    sort(a, aux, lo, mid);
    sort(a, aux, mid + 1, hi);
    merge(a, aux, lo, mid, hi);
}

public static void merge(Comparable[] array, Comparable[] aux, int lo, int mid, int hi) {
    assert isSorted(array, lo, mid);
    assert isSorted(array, mid + 1, hi);

    // pointer for 'array'
    int i = lo;
    // pointer for 'aux'
    int j = mid + 1;

    // copy both sections of 'array' to 'aux'
    for (int k = lo; k <= hi; k++)
        aux[k] = array[k];
    
    // combine & sort the two sections
    /*
       if (section1[i] < section2[j]) {
           combined.push(section2[j])
           j++
       } else {
           combined.push(section1[i])
           i++
       }
       (rest of checks to ensure 'i' and 'j' are
       within the bounds of the arrays)
    */
    for (int k = lo; k <= hi; k++) {
        if (i > mid)
            array[k] = aux[j++];
        else if (j > hi)
            array[k] = aux[i++];
        else if (less(aux[j], aux[i]))
            array[k] = aux[j++];
        else
            array[k] = aux[i++];
    }

    assert isSorted(a, lo, hi);
}
```

## Compared to [[ser222.sorting.insertion-sort]]

(measurements are not representative of real-world performance, just to provide a sense of scale, insertion sort in particular isn't nearly that bad on modern hardware)

### Insertion sort

| computer | thousand | million   | billion   |
| -------- | -------- | --------- | --------- |
| home     | instant  | 2.8 hours | 317 years |
| super    | instant  | 1 second  | 1 week    |

### Merge sort

| computer | thousand | million  | billion |
| -------- | -------- | -------- | ------- |
| home     | instant  | 1 second | 18 min  |
| super    | instant  | instant  | instant |

## Proving claim

> "Top-down mergesort uses between $\frac12n\log(n)$ and $n\log{n}$ compares to sort any array of length $N$"

- Proof via direct construction:
    - Let $C(n)$ represent the number of comparisons for an input of $n$ elements

### Proof formulation

- Write recurrence for $C(n)$
    - $C(0)=0$ (loop in merge doesn't run)
    - $C(1)=0$ (2nd branch only in merge)
    - Our recurrence is then

$$
C(n) = \begin{cases}
    0 &\text{if }n=0\text{ or }n=1 \\
    C(|\frac{n}{2}|)+C(|\frac{n}{2}|)+n
\end{cases}
$$

- Let $n$ look like a power of two
    - Since $n=2^k$ and $\log{n}=k$...

$$
C(n)=n\log{n}
$$
