Bounding functions allow for "noisy" regions to be ignored. The bounds will remain stable until some threshold is met.
^main
### Upper Bounds
- [[ser222.algorithms.asymptotics.upper-bounds.big-oh]]
- [[ser222.algorithms.asymptotics.upper-bounds.big-oh-logs]]
### Lower Bounds
- [[ser222.algorithms.asymptotics.lower-bounds.omega]]
### Tight Bounds
- Consider the functions $x^4$ and $x^4+2x$
    - They almost exactly follow each other for large values of $n$
- [[ser222.algorithms.asymptotics.tight-bounds.tilde]]
- [[ser222.algorithms.asymptotics.tight-bound.theta]]
## Ranking bounds
- Once you have a bound, use the following hierarchy to rank terms
    - $1<\log{n}<n<n\log<n^c<c^n<c^{c^n}$
