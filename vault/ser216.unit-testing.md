## When unit tests are written

- Traditionally, after the source code is written
- In [[ser216.software-development-lifecycle.agile-method.extreme-programming]] & [[ser216.test-driven-development]], before the source code is written

## Types of unit tests

- Static testing (compile-time)
    - [[ser216.unit-testing.static-analysis]]
    - Code review
        - Walk-through (informal)
        - Inspection (formal)
