- Construct a partial implementation of a total system
- Then slowly add increased functionality
- The incremental model prioritizes requirements of the system and then implements them in groups
- Each subsequent release of the system adds function to the previous release, until all designed functionality has been implemented
## Strengths
- Develop major functions first
- Each release delivers an operational product
- Customer can respond to each build
- Uses "divide-and-conquer" breakdown of tasks
- Lowers initial delivery cost
- Initial delivery is faster
- Customers get vital functionality early
- Risk of changing requirements is reduced
## Deficiencies
- Requires good planning and design
- Requires early definition of a functional system and increments
- Well-defined module interfaces are required
- Total cost of system is not lower (though it may appear to be)
## Use-cases
- Risk, funding, schedule, program complexity, or need for early realization of benefits
- Most requirements are known up-front but are expected to evolve
- A need to get basic functionality to the market early
- On projects which have lengthy development schedules
- On projects with new technology
