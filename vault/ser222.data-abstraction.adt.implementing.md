## [[Common Object Methods|ser222.java.object]]
```Java
//from Sedgewick and Wayne
@Override
public boolean equals(Object o) {
    if (o == null) return false;
    if (o.getClass() != this.getClass())
    return false;
Point2D p = (Point2D) o;
    return this.x() == p.x() &&
        this.y() == p.y();
}
@Override
public String toString() {
    return "(" + x + ", " + y + ")";
}
```
## [[ser222.java.interface]]
### Benefits
- Isolate implementation from functionality
- Can use before implementation is complete
- No need to expose code
```Java
public interface IncrementCounter {
    //Increments the counter by one.
    void increment();
    //Returns the increments since creation.
    int tally();
    //Returns a string representation.
    String toString();
}
```
## [[ser222.immutability]]
- Since ADTs are implemented as objects,
they are stored by Java as references.
- This means they are subject to the
referential issues outlined earlier.
- A solution: a datatype is said to be
immutable when its state cannot change
after its creation.
- Generally: make member variables final
and do not provide mutator methods.
- Be careful with objects (arrays!) â€“ they
are reference types.
```Java
//from Sedgewick and Wayne
public final class Point2D {
    private final double x;
    private final double y;
    public Point2D(double x, double y) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
    }
    public double x() {
        return x;
    }
    ...
```
## Exceptions
- Don't generate an ADT with a bad state
- Throw an exception when given invalid arguments
```Java
//from Sedgewick and Wayne
public Point2D(double x, double y) {
    if (Double.isInfinite(x) || Double.isInfinite(y))
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Coordinates must be finite");
    if (Double.isNaN(x) || Double.isNaN(y))
    throw new IllegalArgumentException("Coordinates cannot be NaN");
    ...
```
