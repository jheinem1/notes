Polynomials are functions of the form

$$
f(x)=a_nx^n+a_{n-1}x^{n-1}+\cdots+a_1x+a_0
$$

where the [[coefficients|mat266.coefficient]] $a_0$, $a_1$, $...$, $a_n$ are real numbers with $a_n\ne0$ and the nonnegative integer $n$ is the degree of the polynomial. The domain of any polynomial is the set of all real numbers. An $n$ th-degree polynomial can have as many as $n$ real zeros or rootsâ€”values of $x$ at which $f(x)=0$, which correspond to points at which the graph of $f$ intersects the $x$-axis.

**Note:** One version of the Fundamental Theorem of Algebra states that a nonzero polynomial of degree $n$ has exactly $n$ roots (possibly complex), counting each root up to its multiplicity.
