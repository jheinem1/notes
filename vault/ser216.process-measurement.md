## Principles
- To be useful, measurements should be...
    - Gathered for a specific purpose
        - Time spent taking measurements is time not spent coding!
    - Explicitly defined
        - You need to be sure where things go
    - Properly managed & used
        - If not handled well, the measurements are useless
- Measuring your process will not improve it
    - You must make process changes to achieve lasting improvement
## Purposes
- We measure to...
    - Understand and manage change
    - Predict or plan for the future
    - Compare one product, process, or organization with another
    - Determine adherence to standards
        - These standards are usually related to the product or industry, e.g. FAA standards for flight equipment
    - Provide a basis for control
## Types
- We generally need objective and explicit measures
- To be useful, we need relationships that correlate...
    - Program size vs development hours
    - Cost distributions
    - Defect densities
- We also see a controlling or predictive capability
    - Actions to reduce test defects
    - Steps to improve review quality
    - Means to improve review quality
## In PSP
- The basic [[PSP|ser216.personal-software-process]] data are...
    - Program size
    - Time spent by phase
    - Defects found and injected by phase
- Both actual and estimated data are gathered on every item
- Measures derives from this data include...
    - Support planning
    - Characterizing process quality
### Size measures
- The goals of the [[PSP|ser216.personal-software-process]] size measures are to...
    - Define a consistent size measure
    - Establish a basis for normalizing time and defect data
    - Help make better size estimates
- Some questions this data can help to answer are...
    - What size program did I plan to develop?
    - How good was my size estimate?
    - What was the completed size of the finished program>
### Time measures
- The goals of the PSP time measures are to...
    - Determine how much time you spend in each PSP phase
    - Help you to make better time estimates
- Typical questions this data can help answer are
    - How much time did I spend by PSP phase?
    - How much time did I *plan* to spend by PSP phase?
### Defect measures
- The goals of the PSP defect measures are to...
    - Provide a historical baseline of defect data
    - Understand the numbers and types of defects injected
    - Understand the relative cost of removing defects in each [[PSP|ser216.personal-software-process]] phase
- Some questions this data can help answer are...
    - How many defects did I make in each phase?
    - How many defects did I remove in each phase
    - How much time did it take to find and fix each defect?
## Size vs development effort
- The principle requirement:
    - If the size measure is not directly related to the development cost, it is not worth using
- There are many possible measures
    - Database elements
    - Lines of code (LOC)
    - Function points
    - Pages, screens, scripts, reports
- The size measure should be sensitive to the environment (language, design, and development practice)
## Relationship to development
- File sizes are often an acceptable measure for document development
- Lines of code is usually a good measure for developing source programs like C/C++/Java/Python
- Other possible measures are function points, screens, modules, database elements, and maintenance fixes
## Measurement precision
- When two people measure the same thing, will they get the same result
    - To do so requires a precise measurement definition
- The measurement must also be properly applied
    - Different people will likely have different definitions of database elements
        - C++ code does not equate to assembly
        - New lines of code are not the same as modified lines of code
        - Logical lines of code do not equate to physical lines of code
        - One person's lines of code may not relate to someone else's lines of code
## Machine countable
- Manual size counting is time-consuming and inaccurate
- Automated counters will only work for defined product characteristics
- Counters can be complex, depending on the...
    - Size definition selected
    - Counting method used
## Suitable for early planning
- For making the initial project plans, measures are needed that you can visualize at the beginning of the job
    - For a house, square feet predicts cost
    - Few people can visualize a house in terms of square feet of living space
    - Number of rooms is more intuitive
- Intuitive size measures are generally needed for initial plans
- Unfortunately, popular intuitive measures are not often measurable, and popular measurable measures are not intuitive
- Function points
    - Intuitive
    - Not directly measurable
- Lines of code
    - Not intuitive
    - Directly measurable
## LOC measurement
- The suggested [[PSP|ser216.personal-software-process]] lines of code measure uses logical (vs physical) lines of code
- Statement specifications
    - Executable
    - Non-executable
    - Counted statement types
- Application
    - Language and code type
    - Origins and usage
## Counting program size
- Logical lines
    - Invariant to editing changes
    - Correlate with development environment
    - Uniquely definable
    - Complex to count
- Physical lines
    - Easy to count
    - Not invariant
    - Must be precisely defined for each case
- The [[PSP|ser216.personal-software-process]] uses a coding standard and a physical counter for lines-of-code size measures
    - Defining coding standard
    - Physical line for each logical line
- This standard must be faithfully followed
- Then, physical line counting equals logical line counting
## PSP's LOC counting standard
- Count all statements, this includes...
    - `begin`, `end`, `if`, `then`, `else`
    - `{`, `}`, `;`, `.`
    - Declarations, directives, headers, etc.
