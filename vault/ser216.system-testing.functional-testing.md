Tests the functionality of a system.

## Overview

- Test cases are designed from the requirements/user manual and centered around key functions
- The system is treated as a [[black-box|ser216.unit-testing.black-box-testing]]
- [[Unit test|ser216.unit-testing]] cases can be reused, but new test cases have to be developed as well
