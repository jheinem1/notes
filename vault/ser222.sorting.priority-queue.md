- Until now, we have been concerned with the idea of transforming an entire collection of elements into a sorted order
- However, we don't always need all the information that a sort finds
- Sometimes we are only interested in finding the smallest or largest element in a collection
- The priority queue is a data structure that allows us to do this in $O(n\log{n})$ time

## Sample problem

- Imagine a very large list of data elements, and we want to know what the `M` largest elements are
- Since the list is very large, we don't want to sort the entire list
- We could also try comparing each element to the elements already seen, but this gives us a $O(Mn)$ algorithm

## Key concepts

- The basic idea of a priority queue is to provide two methods:
    - `insert`: add an element to the queue
    - `delMax`: remove the element with the highest priority

## Implementation- laziness vs eagerness

- In the context of sorting, we can think about implementing a priority queue in either **insert** or **delete**
    - We could be *lazy*, and only find the maximum of the data for each **delete**
        - In a lazy implementation, `insert` is $O(1)$ and `delMax` is $O(n)$
    - We could be *eager*, and maintain a sorted list of the data for each **insert**
        - In an eager implementation, `insert` is $O(n)$ and `delMax` is $O(1)$
    - The disadvantage of both of these is they still run in $O(n)$ time

## API

```java
public interface MaxPQ<Key extends Comparable<Key>> {
    /** create a priority queue */
    MaxPQ();
    /** create a priority queue of initial size {@code max} */
    MaxPQ(int max);
    /** create a priority queue from the keys in {@code a[]} */
    MaxPQ(Key[] a);
    /** insert a key into the priorty queue */
    void insert(Key x);
    /** return the largest key on the priority queue */
    Key max();
    /** delete and return the largest key on the priority queue */
    Key delMax();
    /** returns {@code true} if the priority queue is empty */
    boolean isEmpty();
    /** returns the number of keys on the priority queue */
    int size();
}
```

## API sample client

```java
public class TopM {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        // print the top 'M' lines in the input stream
        int M = Integer.parseInt(args[0]);
        MinPQ<Transaction> pq = new MinPQ<Transaction>();
        while (StdIn.hasNextLine()) {
            // create an entry from the next line and put on the PQ
            pq.insert(new Transaction(StdIn.readLine()));
            if (pq.size() > M) {
                // remove the smallest item from the PQ
                pq.delMin();
            }
        }
        Stack<Transaction> stack = new Stack<Transaction>();
        while (!pq.isEmpty())
            stack.push(pq.delMin());
        for (Transaction t : stack)
            StdOut.println(t);
    }
}
```

## Heap implementation

- The ideal implementation of a priority queue is a [[ser222.heap]]
    - This enables $O(n\log{n})$ time for `insert` and `delMax`
- Although a priority queue is structured as an array, it can be represented as a binary tree
    - ![](/assets/images/2022-03-02-11-31-13.png)
    - For some node $k$:
        - $p=\lfloor\frac{k}{2}\rfloor$ is the parent of $k$
        - $cl=2k$ is the left child of $k$
        - $cr=2k+1$ is the right child of $k$
- We can use [[Sink|ser222.heap#Sink]] and [[Swim|ser222.heap#Swim]] to implement `insert` and `delMax`

```java
public void insert(Key v) {
    pq[++N] = v;
    swim(N);
}
```

```java
public Key delMax() {
    Key max = pq[1];
    exch(1, N--);
    pq[N + 1] = null;
    sink(1);
    return max;
}
```

- This makes the final code look something like [[this|ser222.sorting.priority-queue.final-code]]

## Heap sorts

- The simplest way to sort an array with a priority queue is to insert all the elements ($n\log{n}$), and then list them out ($n\log{n}$)
- The other way is to do it in place, treating the array as a priority queue, and fixing tree issues one layer at a time
    - Then, taking out the largest elements and putting them in the final position

```java
public void sort(Comparable[] a) {
    int N = a.length;
    for (int k = N / 2; k >= 1; k--)
        sink(a, k, N);
        while (N > 1) {
            exch(a, 1, N--);
            sink(a, 1, N);
        }
}
```
