## Strengths
- Emphasize planning for verification and validation of the product in early stages of product development
- Each deliverable must be testable
- project management can track progress by milestones
- Easy to use
## Weaknesses

- Does not handle iteration/phases well
- Does not handle changes in requirements
- Does not contain risk analysis
- Not entirely realistic
## When to use
- Systems requiring high reliability (e.g. hospitals)
- All requirements known up front
- When it can be modified to handle changing requirements beyond analysis phase
- Solution and technology are known
