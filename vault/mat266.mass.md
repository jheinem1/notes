Mass = [[mat266.density]] * [[mat266.volume]]
## Mass of a one-dimensional object
Suppose a thin bar or wire is represented by the interval $a\leq x\leq b$ with a density function $\rho$ (that's called "rho" apparently) (with units of mass per length). The **mass** of the object is
$$
m=\int_a^b{\rho(x)}{dx}\text.
$$
