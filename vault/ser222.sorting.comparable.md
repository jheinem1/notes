- Normally, numbers are compared using `<`, `>`, and `==`
    - However, we need to extend this to objects
- Java supports a `Comparable` interface which defines a method called `compareTo`
    - `compareTo` returns
        - `-1` if `v` is less than `w` in `compareTo(v, w)`
        - `0` if `v` is equal to `w` in `compareTo(v, w)`
        - `1` if `v` is greater than `w` in `compareTo(v, w)`
- Should throw exception if wrong types used
    - May also throw error if `null` passed as argument

```java
public class Date implements Comparable<Date> { 
    private final int month, day, year;
    public Date(int m, int d, int y) {
        month = m;
        day = d;
        year = y;
    }
    @Override
    public int compareTo(Date that) {
        if (that.getClass() != this.getClass())
            throw new ClassCastException();
        if (this.year < that.year)
            return -1;
        if (this.year > that.year)
            return 1;
        if (this.month < that.month)
            return -1;
        if (this.month > that.month)
            return 1;
        if (this.day < that.day)
            return -1;
        if (this.day > that.day)
            return 1;
        return 0;
    }
}
```
