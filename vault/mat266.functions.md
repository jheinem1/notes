Calculus is the study of functions.

## Definition
A function $f$ is a rule that assigns to each value $x$ in a set $D$ a unique value denoted $f(x)$. The set $D$ is the domain of the function. The range is the set of all value of $f(x)$ produced as x varies over the domain.

A function must assign a unique value of the dependent variable to each value in the domain- demonstrated in the vertical line test.
