## Foundations
### Applications
- Sorting is useful for...
    - Ordering string alphanumerically
    - Ordering objects on a screen
    - Ordering executing processes
- Sorting provides...
    - Structure
    - A decomposition of a list of values
### How data is sorted
- Data may be simple numbers or complex strings
- Data is always sorted by a *key*- some subset of data that is sufficient to define an order
### Approaches
- There are many algorithms to sort: [[insertion sort|ser222.sorting.insertion-sort]], [[selection sort|ser222.sorting.selection-sort]], [[merge sort|ser222.sorting.merge-sort]], [[quick sort|ser222.sorting.quick-sort]], [[shell sort|ser222.sorting.shell-sort]], [[radix sort|ser222.sorting.radix-sort]], [[counting sort|ser222.sorting.counting-sort]], [[bogo sort|ser222.sorting.bogo-sort]] and several dozen more.
- Sorting is not only a common problem but a classic area of algorithm analysis
    - It is easy to understand and can be approached in many ways
- Some of these make different assumptions
    - [[Radix sort|ser222.sorting.radix-sort]] requires integers
- Many of these algorithms behave fundamentally different
    - This leads to differences in performance in either worst case ($O(n^2)$ vs $O(n\log{n})$) or best case ($\Omega(n^2)$ vs $\Omega(n)$)
### Sorted data
- A list is sorted if all elements are in order: $\forall{n},a_n<a_{n+1}$, where order is computed from a key
- A list is unsorted if an element is out of order: $\exists{n}\text{ }s.t.a_{n+1}<a_n$
- A metric: *inversions*
    - "An inversion is a pair of entries that are out of order in the array"
    - `[3, 1, 8, 2]` has 3 inversions: `3-1`, `3-2`, `8-2`

## Java context
Almost all sorting methods implement these methods:
(**NOTE**: `-ea` to enable assertions)
```java
public abstract class Sort {
    public static void Sort(Comparable[] array)
    
    private static boolean less(Comparable v, Comparable w) {
        return v.compareTo(w) < 0;
    }
    
    private static void exch(Comparable[] array, int i, int j) {
        Comparable t = array[i];
        array[i] = array[j];
        array[j] = t;
    }
    
    private static void show(Comparable[] array) {
        for (int i = 0; i < array.length; i++)
            System.out.print(array[i] + " ");
        System.out.println();
    }
    
    public static boolean isSorted(Comparable[] array) {
        for (int i = 1; i < array.length; i++)
            if (less(array[i], array[i - 1]))
                return false;
        return true;
    }
```
- Helper methods providing common functionality
    - `less`
    - `exch`
- Testing methods
    - `isSorted`
    - `show`
- Using [[ser222.sorting.comparable]] to be as generic as possible

## Sorting lower bound

### Decision trees

- We can represent the decision process that finds a sorted number of elements with a binary tree of comparisons

- Using this decision tree, we can determine that any sorting algorithm needs at least $\Omega(n\log{n})$ comparisons
