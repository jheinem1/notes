- The main difference in using [[ADJ|ser222.analysis-design-justification]] for algorithms is that the result of [[ADJ|ser222.analysis-design-justification]] will include pseudocode in the [[design|ser222.algorithms.adj.design]] portion.
- Although you may not be at the step of justifying a solution, you should start thinking about [[justification|ser222.algorithms.adj.justification]]
    - It takes a long time and will have a different "flavor" than previous examples
    - In previous problems, you will probably be given a finite amount of solutions, however algorithms have an infinite number of solutions
