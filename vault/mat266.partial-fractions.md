Given a function such as
$$
f(x)\frac{1}{x-2}+2{x+4}\text,
$$
it is a straightforward task to find a common denominator and write the equivalent expression
$$
f(x)=\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-8}\text.
$$

The purpose of partial fractions is to reverse this process.

Rational Fraction | Partial Fraction Decomposition
| -- | -- |
$\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-8}$ | $\frac{1}{x-2}+\frac{2}{x+4}$
**Difficult to Integrate** | **Easy to Integrate**
$\int{\frac{3x}{x^2+2x-8}}\,dx$ | $\int{(\frac{1}{x-2}+\frac{2}{x+4})}\,dx$

## Simple Linear Factors

Suppose $f(x)=\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}$, where $p$ and $q$ are polynomials with no common factors and with the degree of $p$ less than the degree of $q$.

### Step 1

Factor the denominator $q$ in the for $(x-r_1)(x-r_2)\cdots(x-r_n)$, where $r_1,\cdots,r_n$ are distinct real numbers.

### Step 2

Form the partial fraction decomposition by writing
$$
\frac{p(x)}{q(x)}=\frac{A_1}{(x-r_1)}+\frac{A_2}{(x-r_2)}+\cdots+\frac{A_n}{(x-r_n)}
$$

### Step 3

Clear denominators by multiplying both sides of the equation in Step 2 by $q(x)=(x-r_1)(x-r_2)\cdots(x-r_n)$, which produces conditions for $A_1,\cdots,A_n$.

### Step 4

Solve for coefficients by equating like powers of $x$ in Step 3 to solve for the undetermined coefficients $A_1,\cdots,A_n$.
